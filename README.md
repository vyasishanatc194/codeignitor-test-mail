Contact FORM URL 


I had integrated simple HTML EDITOR and basic form as asked in the dropbox test document. Mail is sent via SMTP and those details are fetched from the database. 

I had also put an additional condition, so if the SMTP details in the DB are not there than mail will go via default CI config file SMTP details.
